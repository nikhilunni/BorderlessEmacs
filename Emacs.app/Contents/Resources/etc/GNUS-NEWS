* New features

** New package `gnus-notifications.el' can send notifications when you
   receive new messages.

** If you have the "tnef" program installed, Gnus will display ms-tnef
   files, aka "winmail.dat".

** Archives (like tar and zip files) will be automatically unpacked,
   and the files inside the packages will be displayed as MIME parts.

** shr has a new command `z' that cycles through image sizes.

** `backtab' in the summary buffer now selects the previous link in
   the article buffer.

** Using the "X-Message-SMTP-Method" header in Message buffers now
   allows specifying how messages are to be sent.  For example:

   X-Message-SMTP-Method: smtp smtp.fsf.org 587

** Gnus keeps track of non-existent articles for nnimap groups, so
   that sparse IMAP folders now list a correct number of messages in
   them.

** Gnus will guess the real type of MIME parts of type
   application/octet-stream based on the file suffix.  So an
   application/octet-stream with a name of "rms.jpg" will be displayed
   as an image/jpeg type by default, for instance.

** `nnimap-inbox' can now be a list of mail box names.
