not really builtins at all, but offer a command-oriented way to do the

Directory navigation involves changing directories, examining the
current directory, maintaining a directory stack, and also keeping

Emacs does provide standard Lisp definitions of `pwd' and `cd', but

This module allows for special keybindings that only take effect
while the point is in a region of input text.  By default, it binds
C-a to move to the beginning of the input text (rather than just the
beginning of the line), and C-p and C-n to move through the input
history, C-u kills the current input text, etc.  It also, if
`eshell-confine-point-to-input' is non-nil, does not allow certain
commands to cause the point to leave the input area, such as
`backward-word', `previous-line', etc.  This module intends to mimic
the behavior of normal shells while the user editing new input text." :tag "Rebind keys at input" :group (quote eshell-module))

This module causes visual commands (e.g., 'vi') to be executed by

aliases implemented in Lisp.  These include mv, ln, cp, rm, etc.  If
the user passes arguments which are too complex, or are unrecognized
by the Lisp variant, the external version will be called (if
available).  The only reason not to use them would be because they are
usually much slower.  But in several cases their tight integration
with Eshell makes them more versatile than their traditional cousins
\(such as being able to use `kill' to kill Eshell background processes
by name)." :tag "UNIX commands in Lisp" :group (quote eshell-module))
